## Architecture

<div align="center">
  <img src="/public/images/arch.png" alt="Arch" width="180"/>
</div>

Our architecture combines traditional banking integration with DeFi protocols through a unique round-up system:

1. **Banking Layer**: 
   - Connects to user bank accounts via Plaid
   - Monitors transactions in real-time
   - Calculates round-up amounts

2. **Smart Contract Layer**:
   - Gas-optimized round-up collection contract
   - Automated market maker (AMM) integration
   - Yield farming strategy contracts

3. **Unichain Integration**:
   - Direct protocol interaction for optimal gas usage
   - Automated liquidity provision
   - Yield optimization across multiple protocols

4. **User Interface**:
   - Real-time portfolio tracking
   - Strategy customization
   - Transaction monitoring

The system automatically converts round-ups into DeFi positions, maximizing returns while minimizing gas costs through batched transactions and optimal routing.
